### Tool Summary
1. [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) - The Transformers project maintained by Hugging Face is a collection of natural language processing Python libraries that include implementations of multiple pre-trained language models, including the relatively new GPT-3. The project has implemented ChatGPT, which is available for direct use by users.
2. [YaleGuitar/ChatGPT](https://github.com/YaleGuitar/ChatGPT) - The author of this project made improvements to Microsoft's DialoGPT model to make it more suitable for training models for chatbots.
3. [VMware-AI/Conversational-AI-Agent](https://github.com/VMware-AI/Conversational-AI-Agent) - This project aims to build a chatbot from contributions in the VMware community using the ChatGPT model, allowing users to chat with the bot to get answers and support. The DialoGPT model was used for training on the dialogue corpus provided by the VMWare community.
4. [liao991022/gpt_chatbot](https://github.com/liao991022/gpt_chatbot) - The author of this project uses the GPT-2 pre-trained model released by Panhua Technology, combined with fine-tuning and machine learning methods to improve the chat effect of the ChatGPT model.
5. [tommy0103/sdumc_chatbot](https://github.com/tommy0103/sdumc_chatbot) - The author of this project studies the application of chatbots in the medical field, using transfer-learning technology to fine-tune the DialoGPT model, and after adding a domain-related corpus for training, achieves better conversation quality.
6. [turing-nlg/gpt-chatbot](https://github.com/turing-nlg/gpt-chatbot) - The author uses GPT-3 and DialoGPT to build a chatbot that can interact with humans and provide conversation logs to evaluate arguments.
